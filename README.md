### In this video we are going to create a central state using redux store and consume it in our components without passing it as a prop using redux with HOC(named Second.js and Third.js)


Here is a summary of what and how we are going to implement it

### Call the connect HOC and pass mapstatetoprops method & component name in it to read data in React components

### Call the connect HOC and pass mapdispatchtoprops method(method name can differ, just follow a convention) & component name in it to read data in React components

Wrap your App component with Provider so that other components can talk to the store
